Ambient, no shadow is compeltely dark
Ambient can be manipulated

slices 
	• It's possible to slice objects on the x,y,z axes.
	• It's possible to choose the slice from simple or really position (a cylinder can be sliced following its own axis or following a
	real axis)
	• Rotations and translations still works after the slice.
	• The slice effect is unique to every object and not applied on all of them.
	• It's possible to slice the plane differently than on the axes (if you limit it on x and y, you'll get a square) like for example a triangle or a disc.

normal disruption
color dis

• Normale disruption: using sine for example which gives a wave effect.
• Color disruption: checkerboard for example.
• Color disruption: a more complicated algo to disrupt the color.
• Color disruption: a very complicated algo for example Perlin noise (this one is worth 2 point expect if it's the only one
implemented then don't count the last point).
	yes/no

parallel light (sun lamp)

mirror effect
mirror effect adjustable
transparency
	shadow affected by transparency

Texture
• It's possible to apply a texture on at least one of the 4 basic objects.
• It's possible to apply a texture on the 4 basic objects.
• It's possible to stretch (or the opposite) a texture on an object.
• It's possible to shift a texture on an object.
• Another library than minilibX and its xpm was used to load texture (jpeg, png, ...).

  More texture applications
One point per implemented option:
• A texture can be used to disrupt an object's normale (bump mapping roughly)
• A texture can be used to modify at some places of an object its transparancy.
• A texture can be used to limit or slice an object.
• A texture on a semi-transparant object serve as a slide and is projected on another object. (2 points)

negative objects (boolean cuts)

usual visual effects
• Antialiasing
• Cartoon effect
• Motion blur
• Sepia or any other color filter
• Simple stereoscopy (like red/green glasses)

• Clustering rendering (computed on several computers) (2 points)
• Multi thread computing
• The rendering is really fast
• It's possible inside the RT to save, screenshot the rendered image.



• There is a summury interface: a graphic loading message, a progress bar, something more than just terminal messages.
• There is a cool interface (made with gtk or QT) with configuration elements like file loading, render control, etc. (if true also
count for the first point)
• It's possible to interact with the scene live (camera or object position, colors or textures...) without rerunning the program.
• It's possible to automatically render with modification between the rendering (no interface needed a serie of scripts can be
used here).
• It's possible to automatically render objects for a scene for example a torus made of a serie of sphere, and helix made of
spheres and cylinders...


• A video made from your RT (share the love on the forum)
• Modelers files: it's possible to import pov or 3ds files (for example), and you can render them with your RT.
• Using 3D TV technology or OculusRift !
• Infrequent spot: like a light bulb filament, the light source is infrequent and shadows don't have sharpness.
• Any other crazy stuff.

Is it beautiful? It's 100% subjective, but everyone has different tastes.
